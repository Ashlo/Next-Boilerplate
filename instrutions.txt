This is a instruction file for the project.

this is a Boilerplate for a SaaS application.

We should be using great structure for the project.
all components should be in the components folder and should be named like example-component.tsx unless otherwise specified.
we are using app router for the project.


Step 1:

    - Create a landing page for the application.
    - where on header and hero there will be Sign in button and Login Button.
    - on the footer there will be a link to the privacy policy and terms of service.

Step 2:
    - Create a login page for the application.
    - We will use clerk for authentication.
    - so make sure we have clerk login and signup in the page.

Step 3:
    - Create a dashboard for the application.
    - There will be a sidebar with the following links:
        - Dashboard
        - Settings
        - Billing
        - Logout

Step 4:
    - We will use Neon postgres for the database.
    - Just to show the working we will create a table named tasks.
    - The table will have the following columns:
        - id
        - title
        - description
        - status
        - created_at
        - updated_at
    - We will use drizzle orm for the database.
    - and on to the main dashboard we will display the tasks table.
    - initially it will not be there the table if not there we will create it.
